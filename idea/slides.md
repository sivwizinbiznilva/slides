- Surviving
- Sensing
- Producing
- Hiding


# Motivation
### Digital Electronics are good at stuff
- Reliability
- Parallelism
- Flexibility
- Cost
- Power
- Development Time
- Modularity


# Motivation
### Digital Electronics are __not__ good at stuff
- Adapting
- Surviving
- Sensing
- Producing
- Hiding


# Motivation
### What if?
- Difficult things for biology may be easy for EE
- Difficult things for EE may be easy for biology

- What if we could have it all??

- Microcontroller vs FPGA vs ASIC
	- vs Bioelectronics?



## Interfacing Biology and Electronics
### What does this mean?
- Initial goal: To use biology as a sensor
- Requirements
	- Transducers
		- Convert biological phenomena to EE ([lots](http://stacks.iop.org/Nano/22/405501) [of](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0250687483850835) [research](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0956-5663%2893%2980024-J))
		- Convert EE to biological phenomena?
			- [Light](http://www.taborlab.rice.edu/)
			- [Shear Stress](http://2010.igem.org/Team:MIT_mammalian_Mechanosensation)
			- [Temperature](http://jb.asm.org/content/185/22/6609.full)
	- Does the application warrant it?
		- Could the job be done just using EE or just using biology?


## Interfacing Biology and Electronics
### What are the benefits?
- Biology may be able to outperform EE:
	- Conserving power and area
	- Highly efficient 
		- Efficiency definied by throughput per unit area 
- EE may be able to outperform biology:
	- Development time and development overhead
	- Flexibility
	- Modularity


## Interfacing Biology and Electronics
### Bottom Line
- Can we outsource from biology to EE?
	- Computation
	- Decision-Making
	- Anything else EE is good at
- Maybe we can outsource a *__standard__* signal from biology to EE?
	- Computational flexibility!



## Applications (Brainstorming!)
### [Medical Diagnostics in Austere Environs](http://www.oxcaht.org/)
- Problem = Limited Resources
	- Power
	- Accessibility
	- Harsh conditions
- Bioelectronics
	- Low power
	- [Small, disposable, survivable sensors](http://arsenicbiosensor.org/index.html)
	- Ubiquitous computing platform
		- Mobile phone!



## Designing a Modular Electronic Reader
0. Integrate systems known to work
	- [Arsenic Sensor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK84465/) + IBM pH Sensor + Microcontroller
1. Generalize the architecture
	- Put other sensors "in front" of arsenic sensor?
2. Exploit possible applications



## Short Term Plan
#### **Goals** for next semester. We will need some help!
1. Obtain arsenic and pH sensor
2. Culture arsenic sensor in lab
3. Characterize arsenic and pH sensors
4. Integrate arsenic and pH sensor
5. Integrate pH sensor output to microcontroller



## Shorter Term Plan
#### Next Month
1. Start documentation
2. Formally map claimed characterizations of pH sensor and arsenic sensor
3. Integrate pH sensor and arsenic sensor on paper
