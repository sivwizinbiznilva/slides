#The Process
- There are two processes we can consider for engineering bioelectronics:
 1. The Engineering Method
 2. Complex Systems Design


## Does the system display *complexity*?
- [A system will be considered *complex* if it is **impossible** to predict all of its behaviors from the behaviors and relationships of its components](http://www.cvaieee.org/html/resp_citizen/Complex_Systems.pdf)


#Test
- TweeColi 1.0 (aka. our jar of bacteria) 
  - Jar contains the most simple bioelectronics project our lab can build
 - If this works **reliably** then it may be acceptable to assume that our subsequent prototype can be designed using the Engineering Method
 - If this doesn't work **reliably** and [*emergent behaviors*](http://www.cvaieee.org/html/resp_citizen/Complex_Systems.pdf) are observed then we may have to revisit our design methodology to either categorize our design domain as *complex* (avoid) or revisit our process


## What is a Complex System?
- Case study: Death Star


### The Death Star was a Bad Idea
- Operational and Programmatic difficulties 
  - [Defense Acquisitions University](http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/ATL%20Docs/Sep-Oct11/Ward.pdf) 


## Programmatic Assessment
- Cost
  - Overbudget
- Schedule
  - Multiple slips in critical path
  - "The Emperor is most displeased with your lack of progress" - [D.V.](http://www.starwars.com/video/vader-arrives-on-the-death-star)
- Performance


## Operational Assessment
- Poor combat performance
  - Main capability utilized only once
- Critical vulnerabilities
  - Effectively mitigated by half-trained Jedi
- Assessment: CAT 1A (Critically Flawed)


## Program Assessment: Death Star
- No Go
  - Overbudget
  - Behind Schedule
  - Blown up before Act II
  - Impossible to scale up production


## On-Time On-Budget Alternative
- Case Study: R2-D2


## Programmatic Assessment
- Simple requirements
  - No superfluous parts or unnecessary features
     - No language processor (beeps and squeaks)
     - No arms
     - No face
     - Small size 
- Simplistic design results in manageable cost/schedule





##Conclusion: Build Artoos not Death Stars
   1. We can create a simpler genetic circuit?
   2. Consider the system *complex*
   3. Do something else
