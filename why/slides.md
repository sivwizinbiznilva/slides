#Bridging the Gap:
##Synthetic Biology to Electronics
###**Why do Logic in Cells?**
####*In vitro* vs *In vivo* vs *In silico*



##The elephant in the room:
##Why are we doing this?
- Why do logic in cells when logic in electronics works great?
 - I get that cells can be factories, but why use them to do computation?
- Answer: Because cells can detect things EE can't (i.e. as a sensing
  mechanism)


##Cells for Sensing? 
That doesn't answer the question:
##Why do _**logic**_ in cells?


##Answer(?): Because discerning outputs of biosensors is hard
- Outputs are hard to read! 
- Examples:
 - Microscopy
 - Giant purple thing in the wetlab (LASERS)
 - Visual indicators (is this blue or light blue...)



##What if:
- What if you had a large array of biosensors that you were using to answer one
  question
- Example:
 - Is this water safe to drink?
 - Has the cancer metastasized?
 - Is the air quality unhealthy?


#Cellular logic becomes very useful because:
- Without logic at the cellular level, you must provide an electrochemical
  transducer for the output of each signal
 - Granted, this isn't a big deal if you have Sufi's device that contains 24
   nanowire sensors...which could be a cool concept on its own!



#Aside: with Sufi's sensor array
- With 24 nanowires in a 9mm package, you can sense 24 different things that
  use pH as a modulated output mechanism

#Feedback from Swapnil
- The problem isn't that cellular logic is frivolous
 - Cellular logic is quite useful _in vivo_
- Perhaps a novel approach would be useful cases for cellular logic _in vitro_?
